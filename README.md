This C++ program is designed to generate a report card for a student. It prompts the user to input the student's name, roll number, and the number of subjects they have taken. Then, for each subject, it prompts the user to input marks for Continuous Assessment Evaluation (CAE), Term Assessment Evaluation (TAE), and End Semester Examination (ESE). It calculates the total marks for each subject and writes them, along with the student's details, into a text file named after the student.
